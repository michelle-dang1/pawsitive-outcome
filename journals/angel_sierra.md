## January 9th, 2023

    today we split up in groups of two it was myself,ryan and triston and the second group was kramer and michelle. we made a lot of progress setting up jwt login and signup functions(i believe we would call it) it was a hard task figuing out how everything worked with the tokens but ended up getting it right after a couple videos on learn and jwt docs

* We made alot of progess today when it comes to setting login and signup jwt authentication and authorization and configuring everything to work with all the routes and we ended using props to get everything connected with the help of a seir due to us spending 3 hours trying every single thing but couldnt resolve it and needed a nudge in the right direction

    Today kramer and i drove, which was my first time driving it ended up going well we setup up athenticantion and then kramer set up authorization.


Today Helped me alot with understanding jwt authentication and authorization overall since i didnt work much with it and noticed reading the docs helps alot which i need to get used to when it comes to alot of things

Today I worked on:

Today, Triston took the wheel. We began by constructing tables for our dog and adoption models within a migrations file. After that, we imported APIRouter from FastAPI and constructed "GET" and "POST" routes for the respective tables, as well as Querey classes with methods that corresponded to the routes. We could then design and list dogs and adoptions. it felt good actually seeing everything work first hand we all felt accomplished.

Today I learned that were all slowly getting better and error testing and regonizing common errors we had before in previous projects.

Today, I worked on:

* Starting the project with all of the members in my group and getting everything ready for the first day

We worked on setting up a system where one person "drives" and shows their screen while we help them code along we also setup creating dockerfiles and setting up the database which took us a bit but we figured it out with some learn instructions and we get it working overall i think this is a amazing group to work with!

Today, I learned how to link the single FastAPI service to the Postgres database correctly.
