today we worked on trying to deploy our application using caprover.
We've been trying to get our application running for a while now but we dont know much of ci/cd and have been struggling just cause lack of information cause its a whole new system that we have to learn but i am really exicted to get it working.

Today i worked on adding test and finishing up touches with our css within the group. We split up into two groups it was myself, michelle and ryan and then triston and kramer. I worked on the list adoption its was quite fairly easy wanted to do more but just kept going till we wanted more i defientily learned more about test and found it pretty relaxing when it came from constant erros to quick and easy test.

Today I worked on adding search filter to dog list and moving all dog functionality from navbar into the list page cause we prefereed keeping it there.Michelle drove today, while we all worked on wrapping up functionallity on the application before we start styling everything on the application. We had a debate on wither we would have tailwindcss or bootstrap we ended up deciding to keep bootstrap cause tailwind was giving us alot of issues importing tailwind. We created some other functionality as in confirmation alert modal.

- we implmented redux in our auth

Today, Ryan drove while the rest of the group were directing and helping our ryan while ryan writes the redux. We used Redux in our token based authentication. Previously, we had to include our useToken file and useAuthContext method in each file that required a token which started to get annoying and repetitive due to something not allowing us to use usetoken or useauthcontect.so we decided to use Redux to make our JWT tokens globally accessed along the project.

Today we struggled alot with figuring out how to setup react with logout with jwt tokens we started getting alot of errors, we ended up getting it somewhat work where we would logout and we would still hold the token till it refreshes the page and ended up fixing it with a seir still a bit confused how we fixed it but will look over the code tonight and see.

## January 9th, 2023

    today we split up in groups of two it was myself,ryan and triston and the second group was kramer and michelle. we made a lot of progress setting up jwt login and signup functions(i believe we would call it) it was a hard task figuing out how everything worked with the tokens but ended up getting it right after a couple videos on learn and jwt docs

- We made alot of progess today when it comes to setting login and signup jwt authentication and authorization and configuring everything to work with all the routes and we ended using props to get everything connected with the help of a seir due to us spending 3 hours trying every single thing but couldnt resolve it and needed a nudge in the right direction

## January 6th, 2023

    Today kramer and i drove, which was my first time driving it ended up going well we setup up athenticantion and then kramer set up authorization.

Today Helped me alot with understanding jwt authentication and authorization overall since i didnt work much with it and noticed reading the docs helps alot which i need to get used to when it comes to alot of things

Today I worked on:

Today, Triston took the wheel. We began by constructing tables for our dog and adoption models within a migrations file. After that, we imported APIRouter from FastAPI and constructed "GET" and "POST" routes for the respective tables, as well as Querey classes with methods that corresponded to the routes. We could then design and list dogs and adoptions. it felt good actually seeing everything work first hand we all felt accomplished.

Today I learned that were all slowly getting better and error testing and regonizing common errors we had before in previous projects.

### January 4, 2023

Today, I worked on:

- Starting the project with all of the members in my group and getting everything ready for the first day

We worked on setting up a system where one person "drives" and shows their screen while we help them code along we also setup creating dockerfiles and setting up the database which took us a bit but we figured it out with some learn instructions and we get it working overall i think this is a amazing group to work with!

Today, I learned how to link the single FastAPI service to the Postgres database correctly.
