Today, I worked on:

* Getting docker files configurated and setting up the app(pawsitive_service) folder

We worked on getting the docker-compose.yaml configured to right database, fastapi, and ghi. We add two additional folders, gitattributes and pawsitive_service. Together we assembled the Dockerfile and Dockerfile.dev in pawsitive_service.

Today, I learned to properly connect the single fastapi sevice to the postgres database.
