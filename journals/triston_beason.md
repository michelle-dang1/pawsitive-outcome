Today, I worked on:

* Setting up authentication, authorization, and updating adoption models

Implementing authentication and authorization for our routers was not as troublesome as we would expect, even though we some bumps in the road. Updating the AdoptionOut model wasn't too troubling, but the queries that required AdoptionOut need a complete altering. We successfully implemented the changes that need to be completed. With that done, we tested every route just to be sure that everything worked properly.

Today, I learned how to transverse the data from the database to FastAPI web frame.

Today, I worked on:

* Getting docker files configured and setting up the app(pawsitive_service) folder

We worked on getting the docker-compose.yaml configured to right database, FastAPI, and ghi. We add two additional folders, gitattributes and pawsitive_service. Together we assembled the Dockerfile and Dockerfile.dev in pawsitive_service.

Today, I learned to properly connect the single FastAPI service to the postgres database.
