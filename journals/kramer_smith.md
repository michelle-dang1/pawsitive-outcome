    Today were worked in a group of five. I drove. Yesterday, the group of
three, Ryan, Triston, and Angel, worked on the authentication of the
project. Authorization was a blocker for all the other components on the
site, so we all worked on authorization together. We completed authorization
for the dog components and all walked away with a much better understanding of
authorization.

    Today we broke up the larger group into groups of three and two.
Michelle and I were the group of two. I drove and Michelle navigated. We
got ListDogs, DogDetailModal, and most of AddDogModal completed. It was
nice to go back to React. Today also really helped build my skills in
updating state and creating modals.

    Today, Angel and I drove. While Angel was driving, the rest of the team
and I guided him through setting up authentication. When it was my turn to
drive, Angel and the rest of the team guided me through setting up authorization,
correcting bugs we had in several routes, and corrected a few models. Now,
all of our routes are working bug free.

As I'm writing this, I'm realizing that I need to take notes to have better
journal entries.

Today really helped me understand FastAPI much better. Watching lectures and
reading explorations is good, but actually being the one typing out the code
really helps it sink in. I have a much better understanding of queries and
routes.
