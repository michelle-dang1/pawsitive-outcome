    Today, Angel and I drove. While Angel was driving, the rest of the team
and I guided him through setting up authentication. When it was my turn to
drive, Angel and the rest of the guided me through setting up authorization,
correcting bugs we had in several routes, and corrected a few models. Now,
all of our routes are working bug free.

As I'm writing this, I'm realizing that I need to take notes to have better
journal entries.

Today really helped me understand FastAPI much better. Watching lectures and
reading explorations is good, but actually being the one typing out the code
really helps it sink in. I have a much better understanding of queries and
routes.
