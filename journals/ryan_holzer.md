Today, I worked on:

* Getting the project up and running with with all members of my group

Michelle created a group in GitLab and added all members as maintainers. We updated the repo name and slug, accordingly. All members of the whisker watchers then cloned a local version of the repo and we dove in.

I volunteered to "drive" today, and my group helped as we guided each other through creating Dockerfiles, setting up a database, and defining some naming conventions for the project. Navigating the examples in Learn, versus examples we had seen in explorations, versus what we were shown in lecture proved to be a difficult task. But we made it over the hurdle of day one, our group worked well together, and maintained an overall positive attitude. We managed to finish the project setup, get all containers running, and even see the Swagger UI.

Today I learned specifically how to ensure naming conventions across the entire project, by searching, using a case-sensitive filter, to change all instances referenced in any/all files. I also learned about creating volumes relating to our database using a username, password, and db name.
