Today, I worked on:

* Merging branches to main 

The Whisker Watchers came back together to merge our branches together and deal with the merge conflicts. Triston drove for the first half to make sure there are no conflicts with dev_1 and main branch. Kramer drove second half for dev-branch, and completed the autherization for the ListDogs once you login or sign up. 

Today, I learned how to work with authorization tokens. Dev_1 team worked on it yesterday, so dev-2 team got a chance to see how it looked. I thought it was a lot to learn, but I think it'll be useful to know.

Today, I worked on:
 
* Making Nav, ListDogs, AddDogs, DogDetailModal React files
 
The Whisker Watchers have split into two groups for the React portion of Pawsitive Outcome. Kramer and I worked on the dev-2 branch, which is responsible for listing and adding dogs, creating the modals, and populating the Nav file. Kramer is the driver and I navigated. We finished the majority of the functional portion, we just need to figure out how to get the toggle button working for the Nav file. We plan to save the styling portion for another day.
 
Today, I learned how to make modals from React Bootstrap. Since we wanted it based on the dog's id, it took a bit to make it work, but we got it to work in the end.

Today, I worked on:

* Setting up migration directories, routers, queries, and models

Before lunch, I drove and we set up the dog table and adoption table in the migrations file. We also set up the pgadmin page to make sure the tables synced. Triston drove after lunch and we set up the routers and queries for dogs and adoptions. We finished the dog routers and queries, and majority of the routers and queries for adoptions. We plan to finish the last portion of the adoption router and queries tomorrow.

Today, I learned how to set up pgadmin. This is everyone's first time, so it's something new for all of us. I'm looking forward to using it for this project.

Today, I worked on:

* Setting up project with teammates

I set up the whisker watchers group in Gitlab and invited my teammates
to the group, forked and cloned Project Gamma, which we changed the project name to, "Pawsitive Outcome". Ryan was the driver for today and my teammates and I helped navigate by looking for resources on Learn. Some of the resources we used were sample code from yesterday's lecture, the project advice tab on Learn, and the FastAPI videos from winter break packet. We used the FastAPI videos from the winter break packet and the example from yesterday's lecture to create the dockerfiles and set up the database. We finished with making an api-design.md file, which we will update in the future. 

Today, I learned how to make groups in Gitlab. I assumed the process was going to be the same as it was for Module 2 project where I just fork and clone the project to my namespace, then add my teammates on there. It was just an additional step of creating a new group and inviting my teammates on there first, then I fork the project under my group's name space. This will be good to know in the job since we will be working with a group majority of the time.
