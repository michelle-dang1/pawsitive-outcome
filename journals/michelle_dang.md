Today, I worked on:

* Setting up migration directories, routers, queries, and models

Before lunch, I drove and we set up the dog table and adoption table in the migrations file. We also set up the pgadmin page to make sure the tables synced. Triston drove after lunch and we set up the routers and queries for dogs and adoptions. We finished the dog routers and queries, and majority of the routers and queries for adoptions. We plan to finish the last portion of the adoption router and queries tomorrow.

Today, I learned how to set up pgadmin. This is everyone's first time, so it's something new for all of us. I'm looking forward to using it for this project.

Today, I worked on:

* Setting up project with teammates

I set up the whisker watchers group in Gitlab and invited my teammates
to the group, forked and cloned Project Gamma, which we changed the project name to, "Pawsitive Outcome". Ryan was the driver for today and my teammates and I helped navigate by looking for resources on Learn. Some of the resources we used were sample code from yesterday's lecture, the project advice tab on Learn, and the FastAPI videos from winter break packet. We used the FastAPI videos from the winter break packet and the example from yesterday's lecture to create the dockerfiles and set up the database. We finished with making an api-design.md file, which we will update in the future. 

Today, I learned how to make groups in Gitlab. I assumed the process was going to be the same as it was for Module 2 project where I just fork and clone the project to my namespace, then add my teammates on there. It was just an additional step of creating a new group and inviting my teammates on there first, then I fork the project under my group's name space. This will be good to know in the job since we will be working with a group majority of the time.
